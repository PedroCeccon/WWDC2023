# Countrivia

>   I have always had a passion for learning more about other countries, so I decided to share this passion by creating this app. It is a game where your objective is to guess the name of a country correctly before your time runs out. You start with the outline of the country's silhouette and can unlock more tips by spending some points. The points are not enough to unlock every tip, but they are reset for each country. If you guess correctly or request the app to reveal the answer, you will be presented with the correct country and be able to see more information about it. Thus making the game a learning process.

## Technologies

    I have decided to make the entire app using SwiftUI, based on my needs. It is a powerful tool, and I did not feel the need to use anything else. There are many great native components,
    and it is also very intuitive to create custom components, which expands our possibilities. In addition, I created an extension of Color using SwiftUI so that I can easily change the
    color of all the elements with the same color. 
    I used design softwares to make a prototype and also some of the assets.
    
## Resources and Assets

    I made a JSON file with the informations of each country, my app loads the file's information into an array of objects of a class I made.
    There's a lot of different images in this app, all the flags are under public domain, some of the other images were made by me. The remaining images were found under a free license. Due
    to time constraints, I decided not to make all of the images myself.
