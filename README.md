## About
CounTrivia is an engaging game developed in Swift Playgrounds aimed at broadening the user's knowledge about various countries and their cultures. Your objective is to guess the name of a country correctly before your time runs out. You start with the outline of the country's silhouette and can unlock more tips by spending some points. The points are not enough to unlock every tip, but they are reset for each country. If you guess correctly or request the app to reveal the answer, you will be presented with the correct country and be able to see more information about it. Thus making the game a learning process.
